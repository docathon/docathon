<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and
tools for documentation. Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held the week of March 6th, 2017</strong>.
We'll have a kickoff event on the 6th, and then a week of hacking and
documenting. We hope you'll join us in person or online!

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.

<h2>How Do I Join In?</h2>
We welcome anyone who would either like to contribute to documentation, or
who has a project (preferably open-source) that could use some documentation
love. If you're interested, click one of the buttons below and answer a couple
questions.<br />

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>The Docathon team believes that coding is inherently part human, part machine. We spend a lot of time trying to perfect the machine half of that equation, often at the detriment of the human half. The Docathon is a place where we remember that ultimately, the tools we write will be used by other people, and it's crucial that those people are able to understand and utilize these tools effectively.</p>
<p>Currently, the Docathon organizing team is composed of several members at the <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute for Data Science</a>. In particular, below is our core organizing team:</p>
<ul>
