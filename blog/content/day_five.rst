:summary: The docathon is over! Let's see what happened during the week...

It's hard to believe but the week has already flown past, and we now live in a new, post-docathon world. Little did we realize the paucity of documentation that we once had, and the cornucopia of new examples, tutorials, and docstrings that now exist in the open-source world. OK maybe that's a little dramatic, but I'm super impressed with all of the great work that people did over the course of this week. Whether it was migrating documentation over to Sphinx, creating beautiful sphinx galleries to show off visualizations, or launching that new project website, I want to thank everybody for pitching in and being part of the first docathon!

Let's take a look at the final rundown of stats...

The final project docboard
==========================

First things first, aere's what our activity looked like for the week. I increased the time span beforehand so that we can get a better look at the context for this amount of activity. That's, like, a thousand times more documentation than there was before this week. How awesome is that?

And a big thanks to our participants!
=====================================

We got a lot of great contributions from people that signed up as participants as well. We were a pretty diverse group, spread out across all parts of the world:

And of those users, we had a few very special folks that really knocked it out of the park this week! Here's our user leaderboard:

It looks like **r-b-g-b**, **lmcinnes**, and **alexhuth** nabbed the top spots, but I'd like to think that everybody is a winner at the docathon :)

If you want to continue the party!
==================================

If you want to continue connecting with fellow documenters out there, we're going to open up a channel in the `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_ slack room. It'll be a great way to connect with the broader documentation community. You can also always shoot us a tweet @docathon, or open an issue on our repo. 

Once again - thanks so much for participating in the docathon this year. We hope that you enjoyed it, and that you or your project can be a little bit prouder of your documentation now that it's over. We're excited to do it again soon!

Until then,

*The Docathon Team*
