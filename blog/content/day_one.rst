:summary: A quick update from the first day of the docathon.

The docathon just turned one (day old)! Here's a quick update to congratulate everybody on a great first day.

Updates
=======

* We kicked off the week at BIDS by hosting a half-day of `Documentation Tutorials <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0>`_. These were live-streamed on `youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0>`_ for your viewing pleasure!
* We also demoed a `template repository <https://github.com/choldgraf/sphinx_template>`_ to help you get sphinx / numpydoc / sphinx-gallery working with your project. Use that along with this `guide repository <https://github.com/choldgraf/zero_to_docs>`_ to help you get started!

Check out the docboards!
========================

My favorite thing about today is that you can totally see a bump in the documentation commits for our projects. You can check that out on our global activity board below:

We should also give a shout out to our docstar projects that showed a big bump in activity today. Here's our docboard for project commits:

Three cheers for:

* `PMagPy <http://pmagpy.github.io/>`_, a python project for analyzing paleomagnetic data
* `cottoncandy <http://gallantlab.github.io/cottoncandy/>`_, a project for storing and flexibly accessing numpy data on Amazon S3.
* `Sylius <https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/Sylius.html>`_, a platform for e-commerce using PHP

We also got a big bump in commits from individual users! Here's what everybody has been up to:

Let's give a shout out to this day's docstars **anwarnunez**, **willingc**, and **swanson-hysell**.

Keep it going!
==============

We look forward to seeing what comes next tomorrow. The working groups will be holding sessions once again, though we've gotten a lot of great contributions from people all over the country! We're making great progress, so let's keep the momentum through tomorrow!

Until then,

*The Docathon Team*
