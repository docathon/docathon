# What can I do at the docathon?

We'd love if you came to one of our [host locations](hosts.html), but we're happy for you to contribute to documentation wherever you are. We'll also have a few tutorials on the first day that are live-streamed on Youtube (more info coming). Sign up below so that we can keep track of your project's stats throughout the week. There are two main ways to get involved:

## Offer a project that could use some documentation love

First, you can offer a project that could use some documentation love. This
might be an open-source package that is lacking in examples, that needs
docstring improvements, or that simply needs somebody other than the author to
make decisions about how to describe things. It could also be a tool or codebase
that is designed to help with documentation or make it more effective.

## Participate and help other open-source projects

Second, you can offer your own time during the Docathon to work on the projects
that are officially on-board. Alternatively, you can work on your own personal
projects (so long as you're working on documentation!).

Here are some Projects that have already signed in :

label, or ask for one to be added/created

We'll have a list of projects with (mostly) clearly-defined projects that could
be tackled over the course of the week. This will be the main watering hole for
both listing and finding projects to work on. Interested? Click the button

## Host your own docathon!

While we'll have a physical presence here at BIDS, we'd love for other folks to
host their own docathons as well. We're flexible in what exactly this means, but
we'd love to know if you'll be working on documentation stuff at the same time
that we are.
