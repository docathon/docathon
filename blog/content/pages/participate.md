# What can I do at the docathon?

We encourage anybody interested in creating better documentation to contribute during the week, wherever you are. You can participate in the Docathon remotely by signing up either as a participant or a project (more info below).

We'll also have some [meetup groups](hosts.html) in the following locations:

* New York City - [Signup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/doc-a-thon-tickets-32309998074) / [Agenda](hosts/gc.html)
* Berkeley - [Signup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bids-docathon-kickoff-tickets-32302896834?aff=mcivte) / [Agenda](hosts/bids.html)
* Seattle - [Signup](https://goo.gl/forms/GMyMPJZ9eLT6eQuF2) / [Agenda](hosts/uwescience.html)

We'll have a few tutorials on the first day that are live-streamed on Youtube (more info coming).

## Signup as project

First, you can offer a project that could use some documentation love. This
might be an open-source package that is lacking in examples, that needs
docstring improvements, or that simply needs somebody other than the author to
make decisions about how to describe things. It could also be a tool or codebase
that is designed to help with documentation or make it more effective.

We'll keep track of the documentation-related commits on this nifty dashboard [here](projects/projects.html)

Second, you can offer your own time during the Docathon to work on the projects
that are officially on-board. Alternatively, you can work on your own personal
projects (so long as you're working on documentation!). Check out [our guide](../contributing-documentation.html) for more tips on how to contribute.

Here are some [projects that have already signed up](projects/projects.html):

## Host your own docathon!

[Signup Link for Hosts](hosting.html)

While we'll have a physical presence here at BIDS, we'd love for other folks to
host their own docathons as well. We're flexible in what exactly this means, but
we'd love to know if you'll be working on documentation stuff at the same time
that we are.
