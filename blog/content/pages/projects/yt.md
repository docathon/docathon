**Description** yt is a Python libary for visualizing and analyzing volumetric data. It is able to natively read data in a variety of real-world data formats used in astrophysics and nuclear engineering. The goal of yt is to provide a uniform, physically motivated interface for disparate complex research data formats. It includes support for data defined on regular meshes, adaptive hierarchical meshes, unstructured meshes, and N-body particle data.
