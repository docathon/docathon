**Description** PmagPy is a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing paleomagnetic data. It facilitates interpretation of demagnetization data, Thellier-type experimental data and data from other types of rock magnetic experiments. PmagPy can be used to create a wide variety of useful plots and conduct statistical tests. It is designed to work with the MagIC database (https://earthref.org/MagIC), allowing manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database.
