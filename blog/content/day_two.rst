:summary: More documentation goodness in the second day of the docathon

As the sun goes down on Docathon Day two, we have more great contributions to celebrate! At BIDS, we held a special session of The Hacker Within, teaching attendees how to set up Travis to auto-build their own documentation. But you don't care about this...you want to get to the stats!


Docstars for the day
====================
We got another nice bump in commits for the day, as seen on our global activity board:

Way to go `PMagPy <http://pmagpy.github.io/>`_, for managing to hit the top three two days running. In addition, we saw two new leaders pop up in `pycortex <http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/>`_, which creates beautiful javascript maps of brain activity, and `HDBSCAN <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan>`_, which is a high-performance implementation of a machine learning method built for scikit-learn. Way to go! 

Our user leaderboard saw three new folks at the top today:

Congrats to **lmcinnes**, **staeiou**, and another victory lap for **willingc**.

Quick notes
===========

A few projects have been working on a branch that isn't master for their doc work. If you won't merge this before the end of the week, let us know on slack or via a github issue which branch you're working on. This way we can give you credit as you make new commits!

We'll try to get the youtube video from yesterday's lecture split up and combined with links to repositories of information by sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you all to keep documenting! Do it for the partyparrot!

Until then,
