                <p>Documentation is a great way to get new users and contributors involved in
your project. It requires less knowledge of the intricacies of your codebase,
and can be both fun and easily appreciated by others.</p>
<p>However, it’s not always clear to people how to contribute documentation. At
the Docathon there will be many attendees who have experience in coding, but
aren’t sure where to begin. This is a great opportunity to get some work done
and to grow your community.</p>
<p>A commonly-forgotten part of project documentation is information about how
users can become developers. Each project has its idiosyncrasies and preferred
contribution workflow, and this isn’t always obvious to people. We recommend
the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Think about your contribution workflow.</strong> Do you have one? If not, then
spend some time thinking about how you’d like contributions to occur. If
anything else, it is helpful to explicitly state that you welcome
contributions in the form of pull requests.</li>
<li><strong>Make it clear how your documentation is organized.</strong> It’s good to have
documentation split up by the scope of its content. E.g., don’t intermingle
high-level tutorials with examples showing off a specific piece of the API.</li>
<li><strong>Make it obvious what kinds of documentation goes where.</strong> It will help
new contributors, and make it easier for new users to use your project.</li>
<li><strong>Create a “documentation” label, as well as a “new-contributor-friendly”
label</strong> for your repository. Come up with some ways in which you’d like
your documentation to improve (e.g., <tt class="docutils literal">#32: write an example for the
statistics module</tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal">make docstrings numpydoc compatible</tt>) and tag it
with these labels. Along these lines, make your tickets as descriptive,
clear, and actionable as you can. “Add references to the <tt class="docutils literal">linear_model</tt>
function” is better than “Improve documentation for the <tt class="docutils literal">linear_model</tt>
function”.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure that your project has at least one or two examples</strong> that can
be highlighted as “good” forms of documentation. Many users will riff off
of what is already there, so if you can say “you should make your example
similar in style and scope to XXX”, it will help them.</li>
<li><strong>Write a short “how to contribute” guide.</strong> You might link to a guide on
opening pull-requests in github, then explain if you have any information
you’d like to see in the pull request.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, don’t be too nitpicky about the PRs that new users make</strong>, and
make sure to be friendly to new contributors! Documentation (usually)
won’t break anything, so don’t let good become an enemy of perfect! Is the
pull request an improvement? Just press the green button.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember - documentation is the first point of contact that most people have
with your package, so it’s worth putting in time to make it as clear,
complete, and maintainable as possible!</p>
