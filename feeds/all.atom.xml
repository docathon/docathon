At BIDS, we held a special session of The Hacker Within, teaching attendees how to set up Travis to auto-build their own documentation. But you don't care about this...you want to get to the stats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Docstars for the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got another nice bump in commits for the day, as seen on our global activity board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the list of projects that upped their documentation game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to go &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/"&gt;PMagPy&lt;/a&gt;, for managing to hit the top three two days running. In addition, we saw two new leaders pop up in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/"&gt;pycortex&lt;/a&gt;, which creates beautiful javascript maps of brain activity, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan"&gt;HDBSCAN&lt;/a&gt;, which is a high-performance implementation of a machine learning method built for scikit-learn. Way to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our user leaderboard saw three new folks at the top today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to &lt;strong&gt;lmcinnes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;staeiou&lt;/strong&gt;, and another victory lap for &lt;strong&gt;willingc&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="quick-notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few projects have been working on a branch that isn't master for their doc work. If you won't merge this before the end of the week, let us know on slack or via a github issue which branch you're working on. This way we can give you credit as you make new commits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll try to get the youtube video from yesterday's lecture split up and combined with links to repositories of information by sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you all to keep documenting! Do it for the partyparrot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/parrots/middleparrot.gif" /&gt;

Here's a quick update to congratulate everybody on a great first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="updates"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We kicked off the week at BIDS by hosting a half-day of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0"&gt;Documentation Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. These were live-streamed on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0"&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt; for your viewing pleasure!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also demoed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/choldgraf/sphinx_template"&gt;template repository&lt;/a&gt; to help you get sphinx / numpydoc / sphinx-gallery working with your project. Use that along with this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/choldgraf/zero_to_docs"&gt;guide repository&lt;/a&gt; to help you get started!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="check-out-the-docboards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Check out the docboards!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about today is that you can totally see a bump in the documentation commits for our projects. You can check that out on our global activity board below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also give a shout out to our docstar projects that showed a big bump in activity today. Here's our docboard for project commits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three cheers for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/"&gt;PMagPy&lt;/a&gt;, a python project for analyzing paleomagnetic data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.github.io/cottoncandy/"&gt;cottoncandy&lt;/a&gt;, a project for storing and flexibly accessing numpy data on Amazon S3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/Sylius.html"&gt;Sylius&lt;/a&gt;, a platform for e-commerce using PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got a big bump in commits from individual users! Here's what everybody has been up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_all.png" style="width: 60%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's give a shout out to this day's docstars &lt;strong&gt;anwarnunez&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;willingc&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;swanson-hysell&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="keep-it-going"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep it going!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing what comes next tomorrow. The working groups will be holding sessions once again, though we've gotten a lot of great contributions from people all over the country! We're making great progress, so let's keep the momentum through tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then,&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to everybody for agreeing to take a little bit of your time this week, and helping build great documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few folks have asked about tips for being as effective as possible during the week. Below are three steps you can take to make the most of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="prepare"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prepare!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to make sure something gets done is to make a clear, actionable plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For projects&lt;/strong&gt;, you should identify parts of the documentation that could use improvement, and &lt;strong&gt;create issues&lt;/strong&gt; so that people know what to work on. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/1"&gt;Here's an example&lt;/a&gt; of Matplotlib's Docathon project plan. Note how issues are tagged to make it clear which are easy contributions. Also, come up with a plan for how you'll get those changes merged! Make sure you have developer time to be response for new pull requests, and be welcoming to PRs for new contributors. We've put together a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/encouraging-user-docathon.html"&gt;short guide&lt;/a&gt; that gives you some extra steps to take in preparing for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For participants&lt;/strong&gt;, you should think about some projects that you'd like to contribute to (even better if they're also signed up with the docathon). Check out our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html"&gt;projects page&lt;/a&gt; if you want some inspiration. We've create a page for each project that has useful information to help you get started, including a list of open doc-related issues. For example, here is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/matplotlib.html"&gt;matplotlib page&lt;/a&gt;. Some projects have even put together a specific page to handle documentation during the docathon. For more tips, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/contributing-documentation.html"&gt;here's a short list of ideas&lt;/a&gt; that you can follow to get started contributing to projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tag-your-commits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tag your commits!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any documentation commits should &lt;strong&gt;include the words &amp;quot;doc&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;documentation&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;docathon&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; in the commit message. During the week, we'll be keeping track of stats on who's contributed. This will be displayed on our lovely &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/stats.html"&gt;stats page&lt;/a&gt;. Below are the current leaders in both projects and users. We'll update these plots a few times each day so that we can congratulate those that have made contributions. You can also click a plot to go to a summary page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="project commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/users.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="user commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_all.png" style="height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, our biggest goal for the docathon is to push our community towards making their projects more people-friendly. If you can say that you've done this at the end of the week, then we'll be happy regardless of what kind of paper trail you leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reach-out"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we're scattered all over the place, our goal is to provide a little community while we're all working on this together. We'll reach out periodically via email to give updates on progress that has been made, but we'd love to see discussion going on interactively. You can take these steps to connect with others during the docathon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docathon.herokuapp.com/"&gt;slack chatroom&lt;/a&gt;. There are channels for general conversation, and a few for specific sites if you're working with one of the groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune in to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0"&gt;tutorials via youtube&lt;/a&gt; on the first day. Or if you're in Berkeley, you should &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bids-docathon-kickoff-tickets-32302896834?aff=mcivte"&gt;join us in person&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts/bids.html"&gt;Here's a list&lt;/a&gt; of topics that we'll cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a working group in one of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts.html"&gt;these locations&lt;/a&gt;. Each site has their own plan for how they'll structure work during the week. For example, BIDS will be working for a few hours in the afternoon each day (that's so we have an excuse to bring in coffee ;-) ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be ready to discuss documentation in your projects! For many projects there will be a flurry of commits improving documentation. Make sure to chime in, discuss improvements that can be made, open issues for next steps, and generally work as a team to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that these tips will be useful in getting you up and running with the docathon. Ultimately, we just want you all to have fun, and to come out of the week with a better, more beautiful set of open source docs. We're looking forward to working along with you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><category term="communication"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>How to contribute to documentation as a new user</title><link href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/contributing-documentation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Chris Holdgraf</name></author><id>tag:bids.github.io,2017-02-26:docathon/contributing-documentation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Contributing to a project is often a daunting challenge. Each project has an
idiosyncratic way of organizing folders, accepting contributions, writing
examples, etc. Fortunately, documentation is a great way to get started. You
can usually make noticeable improvements to a package without knowing the full
details of the project’s API, and there are always improvements to be made in
documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it can be hard to figure out how to contribute to a project’s
documentation. As a part of the Docathon, there are several projects in need
of some documentation help. Here are some ways that you can help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review tutorials, examples, and written documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; Ideally keeping a
critical eye open for opportunities to improve the materials. This is an
excellent opportunity to learn a bit more about your favorite library and
propose improvements, fix typos, write a new paragraph, or improve one!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for issues that are labeled as documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; Many projects have
a list of issues related to documentation. Check out if there are any
issues labeled Documentation and new-contributor-friendly, e.g.:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation+label%3Anew-contributor-friendly"&gt;https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation+label%3Anew-contributor-friendly&lt;/a&gt;.
If you can’t find any, you can always open an issue to offer your services
as a documenter!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve API/function documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; API documentation should clearly
explain the usage and meaning of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; inputs and outputs for functions,
objects, etc. This is extremely important for ensuring that the package is
easy to use. However, many packages fall short of this goal. Ensuring that
the documentation fits a common format (such as numpydoc for Python
projects) makes this job a lot easier. If the documentation isn’t already
in a common format then submit an issue suggesting converting the
documentation, or make this format switch yourself for a few functions in
a pull-request. If there is already a clear formatting preference in the
package, then perhaps you can improve under-documented functions or make
existing documentation clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute new examples.&lt;/strong&gt; Look through the examples provided in a
project’s documentation and see if there are any glaring omissions. Is
there some function that you use that isn’t covered in the examples? If
so, you could create a short script that shows off the functionality. If
you see two examples showcasing the same feature, try merging them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the language of examples.&lt;/strong&gt; Many examples / tutorials /
vignettes are thrown together relatively quickly and are often written in
an unclear and overly complex way. Check the comments and narrative
sections of the documents and think about how they could be improved. If
you see ways to improve the language, open an issue or submit a pull
request with your suggested changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there are contribution guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;, adhere to them as much as
possible. This will reduce the amount of time needed to get your
contribution merged into the main codebase. Either way, try to style any
new contributions so that they’re similar to what is already there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this helps you get started!&lt;/p&gt;

your project. It requires less knowledge of the intricacies of your codebase,
and can be both fun and easily appreciated by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not always clear to people how to contribute documentation. At
the Docathon there will be many attendees who have experience in coding, but
aren’t sure where to begin. This is a great opportunity to get some work done
and to grow your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commonly-forgotten part of project documentation is information about how
users can become developers. Each project has its idiosyncrasies and preferred
contribution workflow, and this isn’t always obvious to people. We recommend
the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about your contribution workflow.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have one? If not, then
spend some time thinking about how you’d like contributions to occur. If
anything else, it is helpful to explicitly state that you welcome
contributions in the form of pull requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it clear how your documentation is organized.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s good to have
documentation split up by the scope of its content. E.g., don’t intermingle
high-level tutorials with examples showing off a specific piece of the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it obvious what kinds of documentation goes where.&lt;/strong&gt; It will help
new contributors, and make it easier for new users to use your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a “documentation” label, as well as a “new-contributor-friendly”
label&lt;/strong&gt; for your repository. Come up with some ways in which you’d like
your documentation to improve (e.g., &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;#32: write an example for the
statistics module&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;make docstrings numpydoc compatible&lt;/tt&gt;) and tag it
with these labels. Along these lines, make your tickets as descriptive,
clear, and actionable as you can. “Add references to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;linear_model&lt;/tt&gt;
function” is better than “Improve documentation for the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;linear_model&lt;/tt&gt;
function”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure that your project has at least one or two examples&lt;/strong&gt; that can
be highlighted as “good” forms of documentation. Many users will riff off
of what is already there, so if you can say “you should make your example
similar in style and scope to XXX”, it will help them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a short “how to contribute” guide.&lt;/strong&gt; You might link to a guide on
opening pull-requests in github, then explain if you have any information
you’d like to see in the pull request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, don’t be too nitpicky about the PRs that new users make&lt;/strong&gt;, and
make sure to be friendly to new contributors! Documentation (usually)
won’t break anything, so don’t let good become an enemy of perfect! Is the
pull request an improvement? Just press the green button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember - documentation is the first point of contact that most people have
with your package, so it’s worth putting in time to make it as clear,
complete, and maintainable as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

While classes and our colleagues can teach us quite a lot about best practices in programming and the potential that exists in our respective computer languages, we must often rely on ourselves to learn about the tools at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the first point-of-contact many of us have with a package is its documentation. This can serve as simple &amp;quot;how-to&amp;quot; guide for how a package works and the API that is reveals to the user. It can also serve as a &amp;quot;best-practices&amp;quot; exemplar for how others &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; use a package. Sometimes it can even be an introduction to an entire field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is important because it's one of the first connections between the human world and the machine world. It helps us effectively translate our concepts and ideas into the languages that we use to control machines. Or, it can be a confusing mess, and hurt more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that we can do better with documentation. While there are a few shining jewels of well-documented projects, the vast majority deserve to be improved. However, improving documentation is very different from writing better code. It requires the developer to intuitively describe their package and the ways that one might use it, a difficult feat for someone who is mired in the details of their package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the docathon comes in - we hope to be a source of community and inspiration for writing better, human-centric documentation. We exist both as a place learn how to connect our computer code with our users, as well as a place to push one another to improve documentation across the open-source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first docathon will be held in early 2017, as a week long hacking session focused around improving our docs and creating tools to make documenation more effective. It will be focused at UC Berkeley, but we invite individuals from all over the world to join in for this week of intensive improvements to documentation. Whether it be offering a package that could use some help from the community, or simply taking a few hours to work on your own package's tutorials and docstrings, we welcome any and all contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned in the coming weeks for more information about the first docathon, and how you can help out. We look forward to documenting with you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;
