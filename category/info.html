                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The Docathon is only a few days away! Thanks to everybody for agreeing to take a little bit of your time this week, and helping build great documentation.</p>
<p>A few folks have asked about tips for being as effective as possible during the week. Below are three steps you can take to make the most of your time.</p>
<div class="section" id="prepare">
<h2>Prepare!</h2>
<p>The best way to make sure something gets done is to make a clear, actionable plan.</p>
<p><strong>For projects</strong>, you should identify parts of the documentation that could use improvement, and <strong>create issues</strong> so that people know what to work on. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/1">Here's an example</a> of Matplotlib's Docathon project plan. Note how issues are tagged to make it clear which are easy contributions. Also, come up with a plan for how you'll get those changes merged! Make sure you have developer time to be response for new pull requests, and be welcoming to PRs for new contributors. We've put together a <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/encouraging-user-docathon.html">short guide</a> that gives you some extra steps to take in preparing for the event.</p>
<p><strong>For participants</strong>, you should think about some projects that you'd like to contribute to (even better if they're also signed up with the docathon). Check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html">projects page</a> if you want some inspiration. We've create a page for each project that has useful information to help you get started, including a list of open doc-related issues. For example, here is the <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/matplotlib.html">matplotlib page</a>. Some projects have even put together a specific page to handle documentation during the docathon. For more tips, <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/contributing-documentation.html">here's a short list of ideas</a> that you can follow to get started contributing to projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tag-your-commits">
<h2>Tag your commits!</h2>
<p>Any documentation commits should <strong>include the words &quot;doc&quot;, &quot;documentation&quot;, or &quot;docathon&quot;</strong> in the commit message. During the week, we'll be keeping track of stats on who's contributed. This will be displayed on our lovely <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/stats.html">stats page</a>. Below are the current leaders in both projects and users. We'll update these plots a few times each day so that we can congratulate those that have made contributions. You can also click a plot to go to a summary page.</p>
<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html"><img alt="project commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Users</strong></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/users.html"><img alt="user commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_all.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p>That said, our biggest goal for the docathon is to push our community towards making their projects more people-friendly. If you can say that you've done this at the end of the week, then we'll be happy regardless of what kind of paper trail you leave behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reach-out">
<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>Since we're scattered all over the place, our goal is to provide a little community while we're all working on this together. We'll reach out periodically via email to give updates on progress that has been made, but we'd love to see discussion going on interactively. You can take these steps to connect with others during the docathon:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sign up for our <a class="reference external" href="https://docathon.herokuapp.com/">slack chatroom</a>. There are channels for general conversation, and a few for specific sites if you're working with one of the groups.</li>
<li>Tune in to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0">tutorials via youtube</a> on the first day. Or if you're in Berkeley, you should <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bids-docathon-kickoff-tickets-32302896834?aff=mcivte">join us in person</a>! <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts/bids.html">Here's a list</a> of topics that we'll cover.</li>
<li>Find a working group in one of <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts.html">these locations</a>. Each site has their own plan for how they'll structure work during the week. For example, BIDS will be working for a few hours in the afternoon each day (that's so we have an excuse to bring in coffee ;-) ).</li>
<li>Be ready to discuss documentation in your projects! For many projects there will be a flurry of commits improving documentation. Make sure to chime in, discuss improvements that can be made, open issues for next steps, and generally work as a team to get things done.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that these tips will be useful in getting you up and running with the docathon. Ultimately, we just want you all to have fun, and to come out of the week with a better, more beautiful set of open source docs. We're looking forward to working along with you soon!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Contributing to a project is often a daunting challenge. Each project has an
idiosyncratic way of organizing folders, accepting contributions, writing
examples, etc. Fortunately, documentation is a great way to get started. You
can usually make noticeable improvements to a package without knowing the full
details of the project’s API, and there are always improvements to be made in
documentation.</p>
<p>However, it can be hard to figure out how to contribute to a project’s
documentation. As a part of the Docathon, there are several projects in need
of some documentation help. Here are some ways that you can help out.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Review tutorials, examples, and written documentation.</strong> Ideally keeping a
critical eye open for opportunities to improve the materials. This is an
excellent opportunity to learn a bit more about your favorite library and
propose improvements, fix typos, write a new paragraph, or improve one!</li>
<li><strong>Look for issues that are labeled as documentation.</strong> Many projects have
a list of issues related to documentation. Check out if there are any
issues labeled Documentation and new-contributor-friendly, e.g.:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation+label%3Anew-contributor-friendly">https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation+label%3Anew-contributor-friendly</a>.
If you can’t find any, you can always open an issue to offer your services
as a documenter!</li>
<li><strong>Improve API/function documentation.</strong> API documentation should clearly
explain the usage and meaning of <em>all</em> inputs and outputs for functions,
objects, etc. This is extremely important for ensuring that the package is
easy to use. However, many packages fall short of this goal. Ensuring that
the documentation fits a common format (such as numpydoc for Python
projects) makes this job a lot easier. If the documentation isn’t already
in a common format then submit an issue suggesting converting the
documentation, or make this format switch yourself for a few functions in
a pull-request. If there is already a clear formatting preference in the
package, then perhaps you can improve under-documented functions or make
existing documentation clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute new examples.</strong> Look through the examples provided in a
project’s documentation and see if there are any glaring omissions. Is
there some function that you use that isn’t covered in the examples? If
so, you could create a short script that shows off the functionality. If
you see two examples showcasing the same feature, try merging them!</li>
<li><strong>Improve the language of examples.</strong> Many examples / tutorials /
vignettes are thrown together relatively quickly and are often written in
an unclear and overly complex way. Check the comments and narrative
sections of the documents and think about how they could be improved. If
you see ways to improve the language, open an issue or submit a pull
request with your suggested changes.</li>
<li><strong>If there are contribution guidelines</strong>, adhere to them as much as
possible. This will reduce the amount of time needed to get your
contribution merged into the main codebase. Either way, try to style any
new contributions so that they’re similar to what is already there.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this helps you get started!</p>
