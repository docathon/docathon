                <p>Every civilization has its heroes. Some are soldiers, politicians, teachers, mentors. And some are documentors. Today we celebrate the heroes of documentation (well, of the last 24 hours anyway).</p>
<p>Firstly we celebrate <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which has maintained a documentation streak not seen since the great Steve McDoccerson back in the late 80s. Way to go pycortex!</p>
<p>We also celebrate the unsung heroes. Not because they do not do amazing work, but because they...do not use Github. Sadly our scrapers aren't working with non-github projects, but that hasn't stopped <a class="reference external" href="http://yt-project.org/">yt</a> from converting all of their documentation to <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">sphinx-gallery</a> during the docathon.</p>
<p>Finally, we celebrate those who are halfway they - AKA, all of you! We're nearing the end of Day 03 of the first docathon, and I'm amazed at what people have put together already. Truly, you are all the heroes that we deserve.</p>

<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We are keeping up the pace! Let's keep it going for two more days!</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>It almost goes without saying at this point, but pycortex has maintained its superhuman documenting pace. Will they ever slow down?!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>We also wanna give a shout out to <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> which is making the noble effort to create a sphinx gallery, as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://quanteda.io/">quanteda</a> which wins the prize for &quot;awesomest documentation in R package so far&quot; Yeah!</p>
<p>And let's not forget about the users that are making all of this possible. I'm beginning to think some of you are gaming the system ;-) but all is fair game in the world of documentation:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Congrats to <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, <strong>alexhuth</strong>, and <strong>lmcinnes</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="two-more-days">
<h2>Two more days</h2>
<p>Keep up the momentum as we head into the home stretch of the docathon! And don't forget to get those PRs merged sooner than later, so that they show up on the docaboards. Looking forward to finishing strong and seeing what you all come up with!</p>
<p>Until then, I leave you with our new mascot, the true hero of the day:</p>

                <p>As the sun goes down on Docathon Day two, we have more great contributions to celebrate! At BIDS, we held a special session of The Hacker Within, teaching attendees how to set up Travis to auto-build their own documentation. But you don't care about this...you want to get to the stats!</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We got another nice bump in commits for the day, as seen on our global activity board:</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>And here is the list of projects that upped their documentation game:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Way to go <a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/">PMagPy</a>, for managing to hit the top three two days running. In addition, we saw two new leaders pop up in <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which creates beautiful javascript maps of brain activity, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a>, which is a high-performance implementation of a machine learning method built for scikit-learn. Way to go!</p>
<p>Our user leaderboard saw three new folks at the top today:</p>

<p>Congrats to <strong>lmcinnes</strong>, <strong>staeiou</strong>, and another victory lap for <strong>willingc</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="quick-notes">
<h2>Quick notes</h2>
<p>A few projects have been working on a branch that isn't master for their doc work. If you won't merge this before the end of the week, let us know on slack or via a github issue which branch you're working on. This way we can give you credit as you make new commits!</p>
<p>We'll try to get the youtube video from yesterday's lecture split up and combined with links to repositories of information by sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you all to keep documenting! Do it for the partyparrot!</p>

                <p>The docathon just turned one (day old)! Here's a quick update to congratulate everybody on a great first day.</p>
<div class="section" id="updates">
<h2>Updates</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We kicked off the week at BIDS by hosting a half-day of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0">Documentation Tutorials</a>. These were live-streamed on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0">youtube</a> for your viewing pleasure!</li>
<li>We also demoed a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/choldgraf/sphinx_template">template repository</a> to help you get sphinx / numpydoc / sphinx-gallery working with your project. Use that along with this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/choldgraf/zero_to_docs">guide repository</a> to help you get started!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="check-out-the-docboards">
<h2>Check out the docboards!</h2>
<p>My favorite thing about today is that you can totally see a bump in the documentation commits for our projects. You can check that out on our global activity board below:</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>We should also give a shout out to our docstar projects that showed a big bump in activity today. Here's our docboard for project commits:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Three cheers for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/">PMagPy</a>, a python project for analyzing paleomagnetic data</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.github.io/cottoncandy/">cottoncandy</a>, a project for storing and flexibly accessing numpy data on Amazon S3.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/Sylius.html">Sylius</a>, a platform for e-commerce using PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>We also got a big bump in commits from individual users! Here's what everybody has been up to:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_all.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Let's give a shout out to this day's docstars <strong>anwarnunez</strong>, <strong>willingc</strong>, and <strong>swanson-hysell</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keep-it-going">
<h2>Keep it going!</h2>
<p>We look forward to seeing what comes next tomorrow. The working groups will be holding sessions once again, though we've gotten a lot of great contributions from people all over the country! We're making great progress, so let's keep the momentum through tomorrow!</p>
<p>Until then,</p>
