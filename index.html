<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's a week where we all take a break from building new
features, and instead focus on making our code as understandable as possible.
During the week of <strong>March 6th, 2017</strong>,
we encourage developers of all skill
levels to focus on contributing to documentation from home or
at one of our host locations. We encourage both
<a href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/encouraging-user-docathon.html">seasoned developers</a> and <a href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/contributing-documentation.html">new contributors</a> to participate!
</p>
</div>
<div class="span-3">
<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Functions are often missing argument explanations,
examples don't run or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosyncratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.
</div>
<div class="span-3">
<h2>How do I join in?</h2>
All you need is a project to work on, simply stop fixing bugs and
adding features for one week, and work on documentation!
You can either work from home or come to one of our host locations. If
you want to sign up for the event, click one of the buttons below and answer a
couple questions. We'll use this to keep track of everyone's progress!<br />

                <p>It's hard to believe but the week has already flown past, and we now live in a new, post-docathon world. Little did we realize the paucity of documentation that we once had, and the cornucopia of new examples, tutorials, and docstrings that now exist in the open-source world. OK maybe that's a little dramatic, but I'm super impressed with all of the great work that people did over the course of this week. Whether it was migrating documentation over to Sphinx, creating beautiful sphinx galleries to show off visualizations, or launching that new project website, I want to thank everybody for pitching in and being part of the first docathon!</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the final rundown of stats...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-final-project-docboard">
<h2>The final project docboard</h2>
<p>First things first, aere's what our activity looked like for the week. I increased the time span beforehand so that we can get a better look at the context for this amount of activity. That's, like, a thousand times more documentation than there was before this week. How awesome is that?</p>

<div class="section" id="and-a-big-thanks-to-our-participants">
<h2>And a big thanks to our participants!</h2>
<p>We got a lot of great contributions from people that signed up as participants as well. We were a pretty diverse group, spread out across all parts of the world:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1839645/23828598/cd21501e-068b-11e7-85d8-ee42a0b86762.png" style="width: 80%;" />
<p>And of those users, we had a few very special folks that really knocked it out of the park this week! Here's our user leaderboard:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 90%;" />
<p>It looks like <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, <strong>lmcinnes</strong>, and <strong>alexhuth</strong> nabbed the top spots, but I'd like to think that everybody is a winner at the docathon :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-you-want-to-continue-the-party">
<h2>If you want to continue the party!</h2>
<p>If you want to continue connecting with fellow documenters out there, we're going to open up a channel in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/slack/">Write the Docs</a> slack room. It'll be a great way to connect with the broader documentation community. You can also always shoot us a tweet &#64;docathon, or open an issue on our repo.</p>
<p>Once again - thanks so much for participating in the docathon this year. We hope that you enjoyed it, and that you or your project can be a little bit prouder of your documentation now that it's over. We're excited to do it again soon!</p>
<p>Until then,</p>

                <p>You know that story about the tortoise and the hare? Where the slow, methodical approach of the tortoise ultimately overcomes the fast but inconsistent progress of the hare? Well there is a little-known second chapter to that story, where the tortoise manages to develop cloaking technology such that it is rendered invisible to the hare. As the hare nears the finish line the tortoise lowers its invisibility shield, revealing that it had actually been cruising along on its own little jetpack the whole time.</p>
<p>Well that's basically what happened today with the docathon. While pycortex was enjoying an early victory, galaxy-hub decided to show up to the stats board (note: this definitely, assuredly, totally obviously did not have anything to do with a bug that I wrote into the stats plotting function).</p>
<p>We've only got one more day of docathoning remaining! Let's see who finishes on top, and who can make the most commits in the final day! I heard there might even be some prizes for the users with the most commits...</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed that we've got four straight days of documenting under our belts. Who'd have thought you could motivate open-source projects to spend so much time on their docs :)</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>There are a few new projects that have shown some great progress in the last day!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>First of all is the aforementioned <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/">galaxy hub</a>, which is an open platform for biomedical computation. Next up is <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, everybody's favorite data wrangling, munging, and pseudo-databasing tool. Finally we have a newcomer to the open-source world, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/diatomic/diy">diy</a> recently unveiled itself to the world as a package for parallel computing, like a butterfly out of the cocoon.</p>
<p>And let's see what the user board looks like:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>OK I'm not even going to mention <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, who has apparently done nothing but drink red bull and document code for the last 3 days. For the users who are not superhuman, we should give a shout out to <strong>mrzv</strong>, <strong>ketch</strong>, and <strong>spopham</strong> for giving us a day 4 bump.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-more-day-to-go">
<h2>One more day to go!!!</h2>
<p>I can't believe it's almost over! I'm amazed at all the great improvements that I've seen over the last few days. Let's finish strong with a flurry of commits the likes of which the world has never seen before!</p>

                <p>Every civilization has its heroes. Some are soldiers, politicians, teachers, mentors. And some are documentors. Today we celebrate the heroes of documentation (well, of the last 24 hours anyway).</p>
<p>Firstly we celebrate <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which has maintained a documentation streak not seen since the great Steve McDoccerson back in the late 80s. Way to go pycortex!</p>
<p>We also celebrate the unsung heroes. Not because they do not do amazing work, but because they...do not use Github. Sadly our scrapers aren't working with non-github projects, but that hasn't stopped <a class="reference external" href="http://yt-project.org/">yt</a> from converting all of their documentation to <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">sphinx-gallery</a> during the docathon.</p>
<p>Finally, we celebrate those who are halfway they - AKA, all of you! We're nearing the end of Day 03 of the first docathon, and I'm amazed at what people have put together already. Truly, you are all the heroes that we deserve.</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We are keeping up the pace! Let's keep it going for two more days!</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>It almost goes without saying at this point, but pycortex has maintained its superhuman documenting pace. Will they ever slow down?!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>We also wanna give a shout out to <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> which is making the noble effort to create a sphinx gallery, as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://quanteda.io/">quanteda</a> which wins the prize for &quot;awesomest documentation in R package so far&quot; Yeah!</p>
<p>And let's not forget about the users that are making all of this possible. I'm beginning to think some of you are gaming the system ;-) but all is fair game in the world of documentation:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Congrats to <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, <strong>alexhuth</strong>, and <strong>lmcinnes</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-more-days">
<h2>Two more days</h2>
<p>Keep up the momentum as we head into the home stretch of the docathon! And don't forget to get those PRs merged sooner than later, so that they show up on the docaboards. Looking forward to finishing strong and seeing what you all come up with!</p>
<p>Until then, I leave you with our new mascot, the true hero of the day:</p>
