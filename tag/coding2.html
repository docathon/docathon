                <p>As the sun goes down on Docathon Day two, we have more great contributions to celebrate! At BIDS, we held a special session of The Hacker Within, teaching attendees how to set up Travis to auto-build their own documentation. But you don't care about this...you want to get to the stats!</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We got another nice bump in commits for the day, as seen on our global activity board:</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>And here is the list of projects that upped their documentation game:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Way to go <a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/">PMagPy</a>, for managing to hit the top three two days running. In addition, we saw two new leaders pop up in <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which creates beautiful javascript maps of brain activity, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a>, which is a high-performance implementation of a machine learning method built for scikit-learn. Way to go!</p>
<p>Our user leaderboard saw three new folks at the top today:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Congrats to <strong>lmcinnes</strong>, <strong>staeiou</strong>, and another victory lap for <strong>willingc</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="quick-notes">
<h2>Quick notes</h2>
<p>A few projects have been working on a branch that isn't master for their doc work. If you won't merge this before the end of the week, let us know on slack or via a github issue which branch you're working on. This way we can give you credit as you make new commits!</p>
<p>We'll try to get the youtube video from yesterday's lecture split up and combined with links to repositories of information by sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you all to keep documenting! Do it for the partyparrot!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The Docathon is only a few days away! Thanks to everybody for agreeing to take a little bit of your time this week, and helping build great documentation.</p>
<p>A few folks have asked about tips for being as effective as possible during the week. Below are three steps you can take to make the most of your time.</p>
<div class="section" id="prepare">
<h2>Prepare!</h2>
<p>The best way to make sure something gets done is to make a clear, actionable plan.</p>
<p><strong>For projects</strong>, you should identify parts of the documentation that could use improvement, and <strong>create issues</strong> so that people know what to work on. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/projects/1">Here's an example</a> of Matplotlib's Docathon project plan. Note how issues are tagged to make it clear which are easy contributions. Also, come up with a plan for how you'll get those changes merged! Make sure you have developer time to be response for new pull requests, and be welcoming to PRs for new contributors. We've put together a <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/encouraging-user-docathon.html">short guide</a> that gives you some extra steps to take in preparing for the event.</p>
<p><strong>For participants</strong>, you should think about some projects that you'd like to contribute to (even better if they're also signed up with the docathon). Check out our <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html">projects page</a> if you want some inspiration. We've create a page for each project that has useful information to help you get started, including a list of open doc-related issues. For example, here is the <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/matplotlib.html">matplotlib page</a>. Some projects have even put together a specific page to handle documentation during the docathon. For more tips, <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/contributing-documentation.html">here's a short list of ideas</a> that you can follow to get started contributing to projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tag-your-commits">
<h2>Tag your commits!</h2>
<p>Any documentation commits should <strong>include the words &quot;doc&quot;, &quot;documentation&quot;, or &quot;docathon&quot;</strong> in the commit message. During the week, we'll be keeping track of stats on who's contributed. This will be displayed on our lovely <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/stats.html">stats page</a>. Below are the current leaders in both projects and users. We'll update these plots a few times each day so that we can congratulate those that have made contributions. You can also click a plot to go to a summary page.</p>
<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html"><img alt="project commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Users</strong></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/users.html"><img alt="user commits" class="align-center" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_all.png" style="height: 300px;" /></a>
<p>That said, our biggest goal for the docathon is to push our community towards making their projects more people-friendly. If you can say that you've done this at the end of the week, then we'll be happy regardless of what kind of paper trail you leave behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reach-out">
<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>Since we're scattered all over the place, our goal is to provide a little community while we're all working on this together. We'll reach out periodically via email to give updates on progress that has been made, but we'd love to see discussion going on interactively. You can take these steps to connect with others during the docathon:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sign up for our <a class="reference external" href="https://docathon.herokuapp.com/">slack chatroom</a>. There are channels for general conversation, and a few for specific sites if you're working with one of the groups.</li>
<li>Tune in to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikT_xnTFHC0">tutorials via youtube</a> on the first day. Or if you're in Berkeley, you should <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bids-docathon-kickoff-tickets-32302896834?aff=mcivte">join us in person</a>! <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts/bids.html">Here's a list</a> of topics that we'll cover.</li>
<li>Find a working group in one of <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/hosts.html">these locations</a>. Each site has their own plan for how they'll structure work during the week. For example, BIDS will be working for a few hours in the afternoon each day (that's so we have an excuse to bring in coffee ;-) ).</li>
<li>Be ready to discuss documentation in your projects! For many projects there will be a flurry of commits improving documentation. Make sure to chime in, discuss improvements that can be made, open issues for next steps, and generally work as a team to get things done.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that these tips will be useful in getting you up and running with the docathon. Ultimately, we just want you all to have fun, and to come out of the week with a better, more beautiful set of open source docs. We're looking forward to working along with you soon!</p>
