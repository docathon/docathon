                <p>You know that story about the tortoise and the hare? Where the slow, methodical approach of the tortoise ultimately overcomes the fast but inconsistent progress of the hare? Well there is a little-known second chapter to that story, where the tortoise manages to develop cloaking technology such that it is rendered invisible to the hare. As the hare nears the finish line the tortoise lowers its invisibility shield, revealing that it had actually been cruising along on its own little jetpack the whole time.</p>
<p>Well that's basically what happened today with the docathon. While pycortex was enjoying an early victory, galaxy-hub decided to show up to the stats board (note: this definitely, assuredly, totally obviously did not have anything to do with a bug that I wrote into the stats plotting function).</p>
<p>We've only got one more day of docathoning remaining! Let's see who finishes on top, and who can make the most commits in the final day! I heard there might even be some prizes for the users with the most commits...</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed that we've got four straight days of documenting under our belts. Who'd have thought you could motivate open-source projects to spend so much time on their docs :)</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>There are a few new projects that have shown some great progress in the last day!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>First of all is the aforementioned <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/">galaxy hub</a>, which is an open platform for biomedical computation. Next up is <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, everybody's favorite data wrangling, munging, and pseudo-databasing tool. Finally we have a newcomer to the open-source world, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/diatomic/diy">diy</a> recently unveiled itself to the world as a package for parallel computing, like a butterfly out of the cocoon.</p>
<p>And let's see what the user board looks like:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>OK I'm not even going to mention <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, who has apparently done nothing but drink red bull and document code for the last 3 days. For the users who are not superhuman, we should give a shout out to <strong>mrzv</strong>, <strong>ketch</strong>, and <strong>spopham</strong> for giving us a day 4 bump.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-more-day-to-go">
<h2>One more day to go!!!</h2>
<p>I can't believe it's almost over! I'm amazed at all the great improvements that I've seen over the last few days. Let's finish strong with a flurry of commits the likes of which the world has never seen before!</p>

                <p>Every civilization has its heroes. Some are soldiers, politicians, teachers, mentors. And some are documentors. Today we celebrate the heroes of documentation (well, of the last 24 hours anyway).</p>
<p>Firstly we celebrate <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which has maintained a documentation streak not seen since the great Steve McDoccerson back in the late 80s. Way to go pycortex!</p>
<p>We also celebrate the unsung heroes. Not because they do not do amazing work, but because they...do not use Github. Sadly our scrapers aren't working with non-github projects, but that hasn't stopped <a class="reference external" href="http://yt-project.org/">yt</a> from converting all of their documentation to <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">sphinx-gallery</a> during the docathon.</p>
<p>Finally, we celebrate those who are halfway they - AKA, all of you! We're nearing the end of Day 03 of the first docathon, and I'm amazed at what people have put together already. Truly, you are all the heroes that we deserve.</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We are keeping up the pace! Let's keep it going for two more days!</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>It almost goes without saying at this point, but pycortex has maintained its superhuman documenting pace. Will they ever slow down?!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>We also wanna give a shout out to <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> which is making the noble effort to create a sphinx gallery, as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://quanteda.io/">quanteda</a> which wins the prize for &quot;awesomest documentation in R package so far&quot; Yeah!</p>
<p>And let's not forget about the users that are making all of this possible. I'm beginning to think some of you are gaming the system ;-) but all is fair game in the world of documentation:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Congrats to <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, <strong>alexhuth</strong>, and <strong>lmcinnes</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-more-days">
<h2>Two more days</h2>
<p>Keep up the momentum as we head into the home stretch of the docathon! And don't forget to get those PRs merged sooner than later, so that they show up on the docaboards. Looking forward to finishing strong and seeing what you all come up with!</p>
<p>Until then, I leave you with our new mascot, the true hero of the day:</p>

                <p>As the sun goes down on Docathon Day two, we have more great contributions to celebrate! At BIDS, we held a special session of The Hacker Within, teaching attendees how to set up Travis to auto-build their own documentation. But you don't care about this...you want to get to the stats!</p>

<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>We got another nice bump in commits for the day, as seen on our global activity board:</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>And here is the list of projects that upped their documentation game:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Way to go <a class="reference external" href="http://pmagpy.github.io/">PMagPy</a>, for managing to hit the top three two days running. In addition, we saw two new leaders pop up in <a class="reference external" href="http://gallantlab.org/pycortex/docs/">pycortex</a>, which creates beautiful javascript maps of brain activity, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a>, which is a high-performance implementation of a machine learning method built for scikit-learn. Way to go!</p>
<p>Our user leaderboard saw three new folks at the top today:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>Congrats to <strong>lmcinnes</strong>, <strong>staeiou</strong>, and another victory lap for <strong>willingc</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="quick-notes">
<h2>Quick notes</h2>
<p>A few projects have been working on a branch that isn't master for their doc work. If you won't merge this before the end of the week, let us know on slack or via a github issue which branch you're working on. This way we can give you credit as you make new commits!</p>
<p>We'll try to get the youtube video from yesterday's lecture split up and combined with links to repositories of information by sometime tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you all to keep documenting! Do it for the partyparrot!</p>
