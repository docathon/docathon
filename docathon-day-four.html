                <p>You know that story about the tortoise and the hare? Where the slow, methodical approach of the tortoise ultimately overcomes the fast but inconsistent progress of the hare? Well there is a little-known second chapter to that story, where the tortoise manages to develop cloaking technology such that it is rendered invisible to the hare. As the hare nears the finish line the tortoise lowers its invisibility shield, revealing that it had actually been cruising along on its own little jetpack the whole time.</p>
<p>Well that's basically what happened today with the docathon. While pycortex was enjoying an early victory, galaxy-hub decided to show up to the stats board (note: this definitely, assuredly, totally obviously did not have anything to do with a bug that I wrote into the stats plotting function).</p>
<p>We've only got one more day of docathoning remaining! Let's see who finishes on top, and who can make the most commits in the final day! I heard there might even be some prizes for the users with the most commits...</p>
<div class="section" id="docstars-for-the-day">
<h2>Docstars for the day</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed that we've got four straight days of documenting under our belts. Who'd have thought you could motivate open-source projects to spend so much time on their docs :)</p>
<p><strong>Global Activity</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/global_activity.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>There are a few new projects that have shown some great progress in the last day!</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/project_summary.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>First of all is the aforementioned <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/">galaxy hub</a>, which is an open platform for biomedical computation. Next up is <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, everybody's favorite data wrangling, munging, and pseudo-databasing tool. Finally we have a newcomer to the open-source world, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/diatomic/diy">diy</a> recently unveiled itself to the world as a package for parallel computing, like a butterfly out of the cocoon.</p>
<p>And let's see what the user board looks like:</p>
<img alt="" src="https://bids.github.io/docathon/images/users_week.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>OK I'm not even going to mention <strong>r-b-g-b</strong>, who has apparently done nothing but drink red bull and document code for the last 3 days. For the users who are not superhuman, we should give a shout out to <strong>mrzv</strong>, <strong>ketch</strong>, and <strong>spopham</strong> for giving us a day 4 bump.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-more-day-to-go">
<h2>One more day to go!!!</h2>
<p>I can't believe it's almost over! I'm amazed at all the great improvements that I've seen over the last few days. Let's finish strong with a flurry of commits the likes of which the world has never seen before!</p>
