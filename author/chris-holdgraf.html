<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and tools for documentation.
Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held in January/February of 2017</strong>, stay tuned for more details on dates.
It will hopefully be the first of many docathons to come!

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. It lets new users learn the
contents of a package quickly, it lets current users quickly answer questions
they have about a package, it also often gives examples of the "best" or
"proper" ways to use a package.

However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there).

<h2>How Do I Join In?</h2>
All you need is a project to work on that isn't your regular day job. We
recommend you choose something open, perhaps on GitHub or Bitbucket, so that
others can see your progress. Then add a webhook for your repository, and
we'll track your progress next to everyone else.
